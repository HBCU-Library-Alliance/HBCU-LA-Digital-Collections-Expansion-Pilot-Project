Enhancing the HBCU Library Alliance Digital Collection - A Pilot Project

Beginning in 2005 with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the HBCU Library Alliance (HBCU LA) entered into a collaboration with LYRASIS and Cornell University to digitize and provide online access to founding documents from HBCUs.  As a result, the Digital Collection Celebrating the Founding of the Historically Black College and University was established.  By 2010, the open access repository grew to over 16,000 objects from 23 institutions.  Although that number has remained stable, a steady increase of use---up 24% in 2020 over the previous year-- demonstrates the heightened interest in the history of HBCUs.  Adding content and broadening the range of institutions submitting content to the digital collection will continue to increase use, provide a standard online platform for HBCU history, and provide smaller institutions with support and resources needed to develop, maintain and preserve their digital content. Since its inception, the Atlanta University Center Robert W. Woodruff Library (AUC Woodruff Library) has hosted and provided technical support for the access portal and for the HBCU Library Alliance's membership in the MetaArchive Cooperative where master images produced as part of the project are stored for long term digital preservation.

Building on this successful initiative, the HBCU LA, the AUC Woodruff Library and Clinton College proposed to pilot a year-long project to add a new digital collection to the portal from Clinton College of approximately 100 new digital objects.  This project will include training for Clinton College staff to perform the selection of content to be scanned, digitization and metadata creation following professional best practices and standards.  The AUC Woodruff Library will establish and test workflows for transferring the digitized content from Clinton College to AUC Woodruff Library for quality control and ingest into the CONTENTdm portal for access.  Master images and metadata will be ingested into the MetaArchive Cooperative for digital preservation to complete the digital curation process.  The AUC Woodruff Library Digital Services Department will provide Clinton College with recommendations for purchasing hardware and software, training resources, documentation and standards for archival digitization and metadata creation.  Throughout the pilot project, AUC Woodruff Library will serve as a mentor to Clinton College providing support and technical assistance via monthly online Zoom meetings.  Furthermore, the Library will document the processes and workflows developed as part of this pilot project to inform future expansion of the HBCU LA Digital Collection.
