Agenda/Notes

Confirm Project Name - all
HBCU LA Digital Collections Expansion Pilot Project
Adding content to GitHub – Cliff
https://github.com/HBCU-Library-Alliance/HBCU-LA-Digital-Collections-Expansion-Pilot-Project
- Cliff demonstrated creating the repository
- GitHub uses Markdown to format text.  Look up in Google for help.
- Use this for workflows and documentation
- Cliff uploaded and converted the project plan into a markdown document.

Review current instance of CONTENTdm – Cliff

- Cliff pulled up the back end of CONTENTdm Administration
- Two main components - website and the project client  (software that runs on the individuals computer)  Third pieve is the server
- Administrative - determine fields and layout
    - Adding collections
        - Collections organized by institution
        - View metadata fields
        - Each collection seems to have a different set of fields (we may want to standardize or at least set a minimum of required fields to meet minimum Dublin Core description)
        - Items tab allows you to look at individual items and approve before publishing
    - Setting up harvesting
    - Configure website display
    - Adding users
    - Running reports
- Project Client - upload content - this will be demo-ed at a later meeting
- Discussion about adding Clinton College content - we may try different workflows to see what works best.  As we get into digitization, we’ll talk about the metadata fields we want to capture and documentation for the data dictionary.

Selection for digitization - Christine

- Shared slides. Nina emphasized the importance of the AME church history to Clinton College’s history.

Update from Nina

- She hoped to have items selected by the end of next month.  In the process of hiring two Library Associates now. Once onboard they will help.  Maybe shoot for beginning of October
- Skip the September meeting so Nina can get the new hires onboard.  Next meeting -How about Oct 20th 11am

- Request from Alabama State regarding Meta Archive - yes, they can ingest content but would be good to get access images for CDM.
- Present at DLF - part of HBCU LA - 15 minute sessions.  Proposals due by end of week - 2 presenter per presentation- Cliff and Nina
